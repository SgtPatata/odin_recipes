        <h1>How to Cook Sisig</h1>
        <img src="../img/sisig.jpg" alt="Pork Sisig">
        <p>Pork sisig can be considered either as a main dish or an appetizer. The composition of this dish is mainly of pig's parts such as minced pork meat, ears, and face. Chicken liver, onions, and chili peppers are also added.</p>

        <h2>Origin of Sisig</h2>
        <p>Sisig originated in Pampanga, a province north of Manila. This province is considered as the culinary capital of the Philippines.</p>
        
        <p>The US military bases located in the town might have played a role in the invention of this dish. People can buy cheap pig heads in commissaries because these are not normally consumed inside the base. Meat from the pig heads are scraped out, boiled, grilled, and made into what is now known as Sisig.</p>
