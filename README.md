# odin_recipes

odin_recipes is the first project I will have to do at The Odin Project. With this, I should be able to use HTML to code ordered and unordered list, use heading, add images, add links, commit to github, make necessary changes, etc.

I will go back to this README.md to see if I was able to accomplish the above tasks.
